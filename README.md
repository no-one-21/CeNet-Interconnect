# CeNet-Interconnect

How exciting would it be if you could just connect all the computers in the college together.

Aren't they already connected through LAN ?  
Well they are connected to each other, but then there are different LAN networks in our college.
You can see it as different groups of smaller networks.

How would share data between KBH and AGH ?  
Well you can't do that (without of course a pendrive).

So what is CeNet ?  
CeNet is a client server application that lets you do what you have been doing with a pendrive till now.  Well we have such a large network of wires running around the college, why not use them instead of always carrying a pendrive. CeNet client lets you share data between any set of computers throughtout the college using the central college server as relay.

How do I install it ?  
Well, the project has lot of scope for developement, but at this stage you can install it as- 

- Install python3
- Install PyQt5 package

- open the directory
